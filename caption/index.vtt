WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to our video on web development basics.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In this video you will learn about how captions help in accessibility.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We will begin with adding captions to a video.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Captions provide a text version of the spoken content in videos.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They help users who are deaf or hard of hearing.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let’s take a look at how to write a simple VTT file.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Each caption starts with a time range, followed by the text.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
WEBVTT files must start with the header “WEBVTT”.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You can add subtitles line by line with time codes.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now let's look at how to include the track in HTML.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You use the <track> tag inside the <video> element.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Be sure to specify the kind, srclang, and label attributes.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You should also use the 'default' attribute to auto-load captions.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If your captions are not showing, check that the file path is correct.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Also check that your web server supports the .vtt MIME type.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Modern browsers support caption tracks well.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But users may need to manually enable subtitles.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Now let’s explore how captions can enhance the learning experience.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
They make content more accessible and easier to follow.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Captions are also useful in noisy or sound-sensitive environments.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
They support better comprehension for non-native speakers.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
In web development, accessibility should always be a priority.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It’s not just about compliance, it’s about inclusion.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Let’s wrap up this section with a quick summary.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Captions improve accessibility and user experience.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Using captions is a best practice for all video content.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now, let’s continue with more web development basics.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
In the next section, we’ll cover semantic HTML elements.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
These elements help define the structure and meaning of content.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Examples include <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Using semantic tags improves accessibility and SEO.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It also helps developers understand the layout of a page quickly.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Now let’s see these elements in action with some code examples.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We’ll build a simple HTML page using semantic tags.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Start with <header> for the top section of the page.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Next, use <main> for the core content of the page.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Inside <main>, include <section> to organize related content.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Wrap up the page with a <footer> at the bottom.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Semantic HTML helps screen readers interpret content properly.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It also improves collaboration among team members.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
That's the power of well-structured HTML.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Next, we’ll discuss how to style semantic elements using CSS.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We’ll apply styles to create a visually appealing layout.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Remember to keep your CSS modular and organized.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Use classes and IDs where necessary to avoid conflicts.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Use comments in CSS to explain complex rules.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
CSS also plays a key role in responsive web design.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We’ll introduce media queries in the next lesson.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
That’s all for this introductory segment on HTML and captions.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
In the next part, we’ll cover layout techniques with Flexbox.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Stay tuned and let’s build some responsive designs together!

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Thanks for watching this part—let’s continue learning!

00:04:22.000 --> 00:05:00.000
